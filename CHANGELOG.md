# ZOUNDZ Smart Contract Development Changelog

## Security and Testing Updates - May 17, 2025

### AuctionHouse Contract Updates

#### Auction Creation Flow
- Modified `createAuction` to set both `startTime` and `endTime` at creation
- `startTime` is set to current block timestamp
- `endTime` is set to `startTime + MIN_DURATION`
- Removed timing logic from `placeBid` function
- Updated tests to verify correct timing behavior

#### Bid Placement Improvements
- Added validation for auction start/end times
- Implemented checks for minimum bid amounts
- Added anti-snipe mechanism to extend auction time
- Fixed reentrancy protection in bidding process
- Added tests to verify bid placement security

#### Auction Settlement
- Implemented secure fund distribution
- Platform fee set to 2.5%
- Artist receives 97.5% of bid amount
- Added withdrawal pattern for secure fund transfers
- Added tests to verify correct fund distribution

### Security Testing Suite

#### Access Control Tests
- Test unauthorized initialization attempts
- Test unauthorized upgrade attempts
- Test unauthorized pause/unpause operations
- Verified role-based access control for admin functions

#### Reentrancy Protection Tests
- Test reentrancy in minting process
- Test reentrancy in bidding process
- Verified correct error messages for reentrancy attempts
- Added malicious contract tests

#### Fund Management Tests
- Test correct fee calculations
- Test secure fund withdrawals
- Test bid refund mechanism
- Verified protection against malicious receivers

#### Timing and State Tests
- Test auction creation timing
- Test bid placement timing
- Test auction settlement timing
- Test anti-snipe mechanism
- Verified state transitions

### Technical Improvements

#### Role Management
- Fixed role assignment in contract initialization
- Roles now granted to `initialOwner` instead of `msg.sender`
- Added proper role checks for admin functions
- Implemented RBAC pattern consistently

#### Error Handling
- Standardized error messages
- Added specific error messages for each failure case
- Updated tests to expect correct error messages
- Improved error handling in edge cases

### Test Coverage

#### AuctionHouse Tests
1. `test_CreateAuction`
   - Verifies correct auction creation
   - Checks initial state variables
   - Validates timing parameters

2. `test_PlaceBid`
   - Verifies bid placement
   - Checks highest bid updates
   - Validates timing updates
   - Tests bid amount requirements

3. `test_SettleAuction`
   - Verifies NFT transfer
   - Checks fee distribution
   - Validates withdrawal pattern
   - Tests final state

4. `test_ArtistCancel`
   - Tests cancellation conditions
   - Verifies state cleanup
   - Validates timing requirements

#### Security Tests
1. `test_RevertWhen_ReentrantMint`
   - Tests reentrancy protection
   - Verifies error messages
   - Checks state consistency

2. `test_RevertWhen_ReentrantBid`
   - Tests bid reentrancy protection
   - Verifies error handling
   - Checks fund safety

3. `test_RevertWhen_UnauthorizedPause`
   - Tests access control
   - Verifies role requirements
   - Checks permission management

4. `test_RevertWhen_InvalidSettlement`
   - Tests settlement conditions
   - Verifies timing requirements
   - Checks state transitions

### Known Issues and Resolutions

1. Fixed incorrect error message in reentrancy tests
   - Updated from "Receiver cannot receive NFT" to "ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall"
   - Aligned error messages with OpenZeppelin standards

2. Fixed fund distribution in settlement tests
   - Added explicit withdraw calls
   - Updated fee percentages to match contract
   - Verified correct balance changes

3. Fixed role assignment in initialization
   - Removed duplicate role assignments
   - Properly granted roles to initial owner
   - Verified role hierarchy

### Future Considerations

1. Consider adding more granular role permissions
2. Implement additional security measures for NFT transfers
3. Add more comprehensive fuzzing tests
4. Consider implementing upgradeable proxy pattern
5. Add events for better transaction tracking
6. Implement emergency pause mechanisms
7. Add more detailed documentation
8. Consider gas optimization improvements
